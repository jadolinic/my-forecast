# My Forecast 

This project was created using Vite@latest

## Weather 3.0

This is my final Weather App I will be doing. Using 2 different API's to fetch data for current weather and also for 5-day forecast while showing for each day a 24h temperature. Used react-highchart to showcase data for hourly temperature. I have combined both my previos versions of Weather App while fixing issues with previous one. In this version I have used Context for all my fetches and some functions to avoid prop drilling. Hope you like it.
